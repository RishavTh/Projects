# IT Home Lab: Isolated Network in VirtualBox

This project guides you through setting up an isolated network between Kali Linux and Windows 10 using Oracle VirtualBox. The setup allows both virtual machines to communicate while staying disconnected from external networks.

## Steps
1. Configure VirtualBox network settings.
2. Set static IP addresses on both VMs.
3. Test connectivity using `ping`.

This setup is useful for cybersecurity training, penetration testing, and networking practice.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
